# QuickSaaS - Hardware Store POS (Inertia + React)

QuickSaaS is an opinionated, type-safe Laravel starter built with Inertia + React. It provides a production-ready foundation for building point-of-sale and inventory systems targeting hardware stores, with strict code quality tooling and an actions-oriented architecture.


### Initial Setup


# Setup the project
composer setup

# Start the development server
composer dev
```

### Optional: Browser Testing Setup

If you plan to use Pest's browser testing capabilities:
